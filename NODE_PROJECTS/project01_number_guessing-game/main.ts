 * This guess the number game is a short TypeScript/Node.js project that allows the user to
 *  guess the number generated by the computer. There are also several ways to alter the game,
 *  like adding more rounds or displaying the score. Itâ€™s quite simple and uses the random
 *  function to generate a number.
