# Currency Converter (Project Completed)

The TypeScript console app is used to convert currencies: the users enter a certain amount of money in one currency and set the currency they want to check the monetary value of.

While developing the app,  variables, algorithms, loops, if statements, and other TypeScript concepts were practiced.
